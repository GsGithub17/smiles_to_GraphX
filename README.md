# Molecular SMILES to Graph

## Overview
This project involves analyzing molecular compounds using their SMILES (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) representations. The analysis consists of three major steps:
1. Plotting the 2D structures of the compounds.
2. Computing and plotting a Tanimoto similarity matrix.
3. Creating and plotting a graph based on the similarity matrix with nodes color-coded by pIC50 values.

## Requirements
- Python
- RDKit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX

Install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib networkx rdkit-pypi
